# Progress log

Append one entry per phase/session: date, phase, what was built, key files, known issues, carry-over.

## 2026-09-24 — Planning
- Wrote `docs/SPEC.md`, `docs/PLAN.md`, `CLAUDE.md`. No code yet.
- Next: **Phase 0 — Project scaffold**.

## 2026-09-24 — Phase 0: Project scaffold
- Vite + TypeScript (strict) project scaffolded per SPEC §1 folder layout (`src/sim/{map,track,stations,trains,economy}`,
  `src/render`, `src/ui`, `src/data`, `src/save`, `tools/mapgen`, `tests`, `e2e`), with placeholder `index.ts` files in
  each not-yet-built folder.
- `index.html`: full-screen `#game-canvas` + `#ui` overlay div, safe-area-friendly base CSS.
- ESLint 9 flat config (`eslint.config.js`) with `@typescript-eslint`, plus a `no-restricted-imports` rule scoped to
  `src/sim/**` that blocks imports from `src/render/**` and `src/ui/**` (verified: it correctly errors on a test import).
  Prettier configured (`.prettierrc.json`, docs/*.md excluded from formatting to avoid churn on hand-written spec docs).
- `src/sim/rng.ts`: seeded PRNG (xmur3 seed expansion + sfc32 generator), pure, no `Math.random()`. Unit tests in
  `tests/sim/rng.test.ts` cover determinism (same seed → same sequence), range bounds, and `pick`.
- Game loop skeleton: `src/render/loop.ts` (fixed 20 Hz sim tick accumulator driving a `requestAnimationFrame` render
  loop, capped ticks/frame, clamps huge frame gaps) + `src/render/fps.ts` (rolling average frame time) +
  `src/main.ts` (wires the loop, draws a placeholder background, dev-only FPS/tick overlay under `?debug=1`, exposes
  `window.__game` in debug mode).
- Playwright configured (`playwright.config.ts`) to use the pre-installed Chromium at
  `/opt/pw-browsers/chromium-1194/chrome-linux/chrome` when present (falls back to Playwright's own install
  otherwise, e.g. in CI), building + previewing the app. Smoke test (`e2e/smoke.spec.ts`): page loads, canvas is
  visible, no console errors, screenshot saved to `docs/screenshots/phase-0-smoke.png`.
- npm scripts: `dev`, `build`, `preview`, `typecheck`, `lint`, `format`, `test`, `e2e`, `check`.
- `.github/workflows/ci.yml`: installs deps + Chromium, runs `npm run check`, `npm run build`, `npm run e2e` on
  push/PR; uploads the Playwright report as an artifact.
- `.gitignore` covers `node_modules`, `dist`, Android build outputs, `tools/mapgen/.cache`, test-results output.
- Verified locally: `npm run check` (typecheck + lint + unit tests) and `npm run e2e` both pass; `npm run build`
  produces a working `dist/`.
- Key files: `src/main.ts`, `src/render/loop.ts`, `src/render/fps.ts`, `src/sim/rng.ts`, `eslint.config.js`,
  `playwright.config.ts`, `.github/workflows/ci.yml`.
- Known issues / carry-over: none. `npm audit` flags dev-only advisories in `vite`/`vitest`'s dev server tooling
  (not exploitable in the built app, 0 vulnerabilities in production deps); left as-is for now, worth revisiting
  with a version bump in a later phase.
- Next: **Phase 1 — Map model, random generator, terrain rendering, camera**.
